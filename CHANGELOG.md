# Changelog

Every change below keeps the UI, layout, wording and features exactly as they are.
Only correctness, stability and speed change.

## v4.8.0 — 2026-11-02
**120 Hz support**
- The Android shell now asks the window to run at the panel's fastest refresh rate instead of the
  platform's 60 Hz default: `LayoutParams.preferredRefreshRate` is set to the highest rate the display
  reports (90 / 120 / 144 Hz panels all differ), and on Android 11+ `Window.setFrameRate(hz,
  FRAME_RATE_COMPATIBILITY_DEFAULT)` is called reflectively so the system keeps the high rate.
- Re-applied in `onResume()` because some OEM builds reset the window frame rate when the activity returns.
- No visual change: same UI, same animations — they simply get 120 samples per second instead of 60.
- The web build already follows the display (requestAnimationFrame is driven by the compositor), so no
  page-side change was needed.

## v4.7.0 — 2026-11-02
**Glass restored + measured performance work**
- Removed the phone blur cap — full 22px liquid glass, refraction, glare and shine are back on touch devices
- Startup: the 2,322-wallpaper dataset moved from a 1.35 MB JS object literal into inert JSON + `JSON.parse`
  — first paint 320 ms → **196 ms**, script finished 3030 ms → **1706 ms**
- Blurred backdrop: full-screen `filter: blur(46px)` replaced by a 20 px layer scaled ~48× (identical look, near-zero cost)
- Loading shimmer: `background-position` animation replaced by a composited `translateX` sweep
- Image loader is adaptive: 6 parallel / 45 ms when healthy, 3 / 200 ms + cool-down after a failure
- Verified against the live CDN: 82 requests, all `200`, 0 failed images, 0 console errors

## v4.6.0 — 2026-11-02
**429 image-loading fix**
- Wikimedia's thumbnail CDN was rate-limiting the app (HTTP 429) during rapid category switching, leaving
  broken grey cards. Added a throttled loader with exponential back-off and a global cool-down.
  Verified: 10 × 429 → **0**, 34/44 images → **38/38**

## v4.5.0 — 2026-11-02
**9-language interface**
- English, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu
- 131 UI strings per language; the wallpapers themselves are never touched

## v4.4.0 — 2026-11-02
**Real-network fixes**
- The "new wallpapers" pill no longer covers the header (now a bottom snackbar)
- Infinite scroll can no longer stall: scroll listener + interval + an explicit "N more wallpapers ↓" button

## v4.3.0 — 2026-11-02
- Extruded 3D launcher icon; the in-app icon tilts live with pointer/gyro
- Responsive thumbnails, `preconnect`, Performance mode

## v4.2.0 — 2026-11-02
- Cards could stay invisible (IntersectionObserver on a masonry layout); now visible on creation + a 1.2 s sweep
- Thumbnails that failed once no longer remove the whole card
- Modal open/close race fixed; live results de-duplicated by title

## v4.1.0 — 2026-11-02
- 4D app icon (launcher, in-app header, favicon)

## v4.0.0 — 2026-11-02
- First release: 2,322 credited Wikimedia Commons wallpapers, liquid-glass 4D UI, live updates, fullscreen, credits
